# Qiskit Advocate Application

Minha aplicação para o Qiskit Advocate (2022). Pode ser útil para novos aplicantes, mas tenham em mente que os critérios podem ter mudado no seu ano de aplicação!

Abaixo, meu pequeno texto sobre minha motivação e minha lista de contribuições.
Veja https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/application-guide para mais detalhes dos critérios de seleção.


- Motivation
    
    > Please write 100-200 words describing what you want to get out of the program.
    > 
    
    I am very interested in the Qiskit Advocate program for two main reasons:
    
    1. I have always been passionate about science outreach, and I believe my contributions showcase this. I also did my best to disseminate knowledge in Quantum Computing and Qiskit by writing several pieces on these topics on my Instagram and Medium pages, giving presentations, and contributing to open source initiatives. The advocate program is a great way to amplify my voice as a science communicator on the topic.
    2. Despite carrying out my Ph.D. research on Quantum hardware, I have found myself more interested in Quantum Software, to the point of being willing to pursue it as a career path. My personal interest in the matter has motivated me to work through quantum algorithms in Qiskit Textbook. These studies led me to palpable results, such as obtaining the IBM Certified Associate Developer and certificates of completion from Qiskit Hackathons. The Advocate program is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate my commitment to learn and produce useful knowledge with Qiskit.

- Contributions
    
    1. Completed all challenges in QBronze 2022 and IBM Quantum Challenge - Spring 2022 (Qiskit Hackatons) - certifications attached.
    2. Wrote several scientific outreach content on Quantum Computing on Instagram in Portuguese. I have an Instagram page dedicated to it [https://www.instagram.com/shinossaura/guide/quantum-computing/17894358713238382/] (with 17 posts about the subject until the present moment); I have also interviewed experts in the field and wrote about getting started in Qiskit on my Medium page[https://medium.com/@smendoncabruna].
    3. Helped to create a Buzzfeed-like quiz that displays the best career path in quantum computing for the test taker, as part of UnitaryHack. [https://github.com/Quantum-Universal-Education/Quantum-Universal-Education.github.io/pull/26]
    4. Prepared and recorded lectures for a Quantum Computing online course by BrazilQuantum and QURECA, to be released in August, 2022. Related document is attached.
    5. Founded a Quantum Computing club in Brazil. We hold weekly meetings and have studied algorithms using "Nielsen, Michael A., and Isaac Chuang, "Quantum computation and quantum information." (2002)" book and Qiskit Textbook. We also organized group studies for Qiskit's Developer certificate and IBM Quantum Challenge - Spring 2022. Thanks to the club, we have been able to plan and execute contributions 5 to 7. For more information about the club, please contact: arthur.faria2@gmail.com.
    
    1. Gave several talks about Quantum Computing in the industry and Academia. The only one available to the public can be found here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xtKDnnp7VY]. Screnshots about the other presentations are attached.
    2. Currently preparing a 8-hour workshop on Quantum Computing using Qiskit for my home university, University of São Paulo, to be held in August: [https://github.com/smendoncabruna/Winter-School---Quantum-Computing].
    3. Developed and curated open-source content to help prepare for the Qiskit Developer exam. Most notably, a flashcard compilation to help memorize syntax. [https://github.com/arthurfaria/Qiskit_certificate_prep]
    4. Selected as an intern on QIntern 2022, under Dr. Oxana Mishina's supervision.
    5. Created a repository curating Quantum Computing content in Portuguese: [https://github.com/smendoncabruna/ComputacaoQuantica]
    6. Slack participation: [https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/CMXDMFNN5/p1655556658714579]
    7. Wrote a manuscript on how scalar impurities can yeald to false-positives when attempting to detect Majoranas with STS measurements. This is a relevant result for Topological Quantum Computing setups. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05078]
    8. Partipation on Quantum Computing StackExchange: [https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/11399/topological-quantum-computer-and-two-dimensional-materials/24216#24216]
